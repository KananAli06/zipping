# zipping
Create an application that takes a file path (String) as an input and creates a zip file from the contents. If the path corresponds to the folder, your application must recursively zip that folder's contents and keep the original hierarchy inside the zip. Once zipping is completed program should notify the user with the path of a resulting zip file.
